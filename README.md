Bobo the Baby Dragon
====================

You need XNA 4.0 installed on Visual Studio (we used 2010). Then open up your solution file, and you should be on your way!

__It also might be a little loud, so turn down your speakers a bit.__

NOTE: Bobo is no longer a dragon, he is a black blob. Apologies.
